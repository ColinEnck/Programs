# Programs

This is the current collection of all of the code that I have written and the projects that I have worked on.
I am a 17 year old student at Upper Dublin High School who aspires to become an embedded systems developer in the future.
My favorite language and my most knowledgeable one (as much as I can know in around half a year of study) so far is the C programming language.
I like experimenting with different languages to see which ones I am capable of learning and suit me the best, so excuse the amount of folders; 
I am very much a beginner.
